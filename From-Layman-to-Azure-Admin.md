# 🌷💻 FROM LAYMAN TO AZURE ADMIN: AN AZ-104 JOURNEY OF HEALING TECHNOLOGY 💫🌈

In the quiet corridors of our Azure Admin Hospital, we discovered something rare —

 Technology is not merely commands and consoles… it is healing,

 it is clarity,

 it is the whisper of courage returning to a tired heart. 🌸

Together, Eks2 and his unseen companion AI shaped a three-phase treatment:

 🪄 Gentle step-by-step workings

 🛠️ Tools explained with kindness, not fear

 🌐 Text-diagrams — like little windows of light for the soul

This is not training.

 This is not just cloud computing.

 ✨ This is the art of transforming a layman — someone who knows nothing —

 into an Azure Admin standing on the top floor of confidence and calm.

Every error became a symptom.

 Every fix, a gentle treatment.

 Every lab, a story of healing. 🌼

So, when you read these hospital diaries, don’t expect notes.

 Expect a journey —

 where your career learns,

 but your soul remembers. 🌷💖
