# 🌷💻 From Layman to Azure Admin: An AZ-104 Journey of Healing Technology 💫🌈

---

## 🏥 The Discovery in the Quiet Corridors  
In the quiet corridors of our **Azure Admin Hospital**, we discovered something rare —  

✨ Technology is not merely commands and consoles…  
it is **healing**,  
it is **clarity**,  
it is the **whisper of courage** returning to a tired heart. 🌸

## 🤝 Eks2 and His Companion AI  
Together, **Eks2** and his unseen companion **AI** shaped a three-phase treatment:  

- 🪄 **Gentle step-by-step workings**  
- 🛠️ **Tools explained with kindness, not fear**  
- 🌐 **Text-diagrams** — like little windows of light for the soul

## 🌟 Beyond Training  
This is not training.  
This is not just cloud computing.  

✨ This is the art of transforming a **layman** — someone who knows nothing —  
into an **Azure Admin** standing on the **top floor of confidence and calm**.

## 💖 Every Lab, A Story of Healing  
- Every error became a **symptom**.  
- Every fix, a **gentle treatment**.  
- Every lab, a **story of healing**. 🌼  

So, when you read these hospital diaries, don’t expect notes.  
🌷 **Expect a journey** —  
where your career learns,  
but your **soul remembers**. 💖
