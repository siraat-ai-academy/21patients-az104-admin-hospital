# 🌸 Azure Admin Hospital — **3‑Phase Healing Blueprint**  
*21 Patients · 3 Core Treatments each · One gentle path from beginner to Azure Admin*

Welcome to the ward, dear learner. Here, every **patient** is an Azure scenario, and every **treatment** is a lab you perform with care.  
Eks2 and AI stand beside you — steady hands, soft hearts — guiding you from “I’m new” to “I’m ready.” 🌿✨

## 💎 The Promise
- **Simple** enough for a true beginner.  
- **Complete** enough for a real job start.  
- **Soulful** enough to keep your heart awake while your mind learns. 🌼

Each patient follows a **3‑Phase pattern** (our minimalist, high‑impact path):  
1) **🧾 Step‑by‑Step Working** – do the thing, slowly and clearly.  
2) **🛠️ Used Tools (What & Why)** – name the instruments and their purpose.  
3) **🔄 Text‑Diagram (Flow of Energy)** – see how parts breathe together.

> In every step, keep **kindness**, **clarity**, and **cleanup**. Healing is order + mercy. 💖

## 🗂️ Repo Shape (One Ward, Many Rooms)
```
patient-XX-<short-name>/
  XX-<emoji>-patient-XX-<short-name>--01-🧾-steps.md
  XX-<emoji>-patient-XX-<short-name>--02-🛠️-tools.md
  XX-<emoji>-patient-XX-<short-name>--03-🔄-flow.md
```
- `XX` = two‑digit patient number (01…21)  
- `<emoji>` = one unique symbol that “feels” like the case  
- `<short-name>` = clean, hyphenated label (e.g., `tags`, `locks`, `app-gateway`).

**Danish‑style names** for any example resources (safe & friendly):  
`NordicVault-VM`, `DKSec-Group`, `SkandiaStore`, `CopenhagenHub-VNet`, etc.

---

## 🧭 Minimal Daily Rhythm (60–90 min per patient)
- **10 min** – Read the purpose and the story of the case.  
- **25–40 min** – 🧾 Do the Steps (small wins, small commits).  
- **10–15 min** – 🛠️ Write the Why (Tools & decisions).  
- **10–15 min** – 🔄 Draw the Text‑Diagram.  
- **5 min** – Cleanup: tag, lock (if needed), delete leftovers.  
- **5 min** – One sentence of insight: *“What healed today?”*

> Repeat across 21 patients. The beginner who entered will not be the same person who leaves. 🌙

## 🔐 Guardrails (Safety with Soul)
- **Least privilege**: do only what’s needed.  
- **Naming**: `patientXX-<service>-<purpose>` (clean, readable).  
- **Tag everything**: `Department=IT`, `Env=Lab`, `Owner=Eks2`.  
- **Locks while teaching** (where sensible), **cleanup after**.  
- **Cost care**: choose frugal SKUs, stop or delete unused resources.  
- **Reflect**: one gentle sentence after each case: *“What wisdom awakened?”*

---

## 🧱 Template — use this for every patient
> Create these 3 files inside `patient-XX-<short-name>/`

### 1) `XX-<emoji>-patient-XX-<short-name>--01-🧾-steps.md`
- **What we will do** (2–3 lines)  
- Numbered steps, tiny and testable  
- Verification (how we know it worked)  
- Cleanup (how we leave the ward tidy)

### 2) `XX-<emoji>-patient-XX-<short-name>--02-🛠️-tools.md`
- Tools table: *Name · Why we chose it · Safer alternative (if any)*  
- Trade‑offs in simple English  
- One “if it breaks” tip

### 3) `XX-<emoji>-patient-XX-<short-name>--03-🔄-flow.md`
- Short intro: “How energy flows in this case”  
- Text‑diagram (example):
  ```text
  User → DKSec-Group (Tag=Department:IT)
      → CopenhagenHub-VNet
      → NordicVault-VM
      → SkandiaStore (if storage is involved)
  ```
- One sentence of soul: *“This flow is breath; protect the lungs.”*

## 🧪 Example — Patient 02 (Tags) in 3‑Phase
**Folder**: `patient-02-tags/`  
**Files**:
```
02-🏷️-patient-02-tags--01-🧾-steps.md
02-🏷️-patient-02-tags--02-🛠️-tools.md
02-🏷️-patient-02-tags--03-🔄-flow.md
```
**One‑line Wisdom**: *“Order outside creates calm inside.”*

---

## 💼 Job‑Ready Mindset (while you learn)
- Speak in outcomes: *“Tagging reduces cost & search time.”*  
- Keep a tiny runbook for each patient (copy/paste friendly).  
- Practice **rollback**: “If step 5 fails, undo 4, try plan B.”  
- Document **defaults you changed** (future you will thank you).  
- Smile. You’re building *trust* as much as *tech*. 🌷

## 🌟 Graduation Vision
When all 21 rise from their beds, you will feel it — a quiet confidence.  
Not loud, not brittle — a **steady light**. From here you will serve teams,  
heal outages, lower bills, and draw clear maps where there was fog.  
Azure Admin is not a title; it’s a way of caring. 🌙
