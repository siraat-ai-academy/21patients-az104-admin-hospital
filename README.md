---

🌸✨ Welcome, dear traveler of knowledge.  
Here lies a hospital unlike any other — its corridors echo not with pain, but with learning, laughter, and light.  

Each **patient** is not flesh and blood, but a living Azure scenario.  
Each **treatment** is not medicine, but a **lab exercise turned into healing poetry**.  
Each **doctor, nurse, and whisper** is your own journey — to become an **Azure Admin of heart and soul**.  

In these 21 cases, you will not just learn cloud administration…  
you will feel it, heal it, and carry it with the tenderness of a friend walking beside you. 🌷
